    <p>A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.</p>
    <p>Can use single or double quotes</p>
    <p>You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string</p>
    <b>String Length</b>
    <p>To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property</p>
    <script>
        let txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
        let length = text.length;
    </script>

    <h2>Escape Character</h2>
    <p>
        Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstand this string:
            let text = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
    </p>
    <p>The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called ".
        The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character.
    </p>
    <script>
        // The sequence \"  inserts a double quote in a string:
        let text = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";

        // The sequence \'  inserts a single quote in a string:
        let text1= 'It\'s alright.';


        // The sequence \\  inserts a backslash in a string:
        let text2 = "The character \\ is called backslash.";
    </script>


    <h2>Breaking Long Code Lines</h2>
    <p>For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.</p>
    <p>If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator</p>
    <p>You can also break up a code line within a text string with a single backslash(\)</p>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello \
        Dolly!";


        // A safer way to break up a string, is to use string addition:
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello " +
        "Dolly!";
    </script>


    <h2>JavaScript Strings as Objects</h2>
    <p>Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals:</p>
    <b>
        Do not create Strings objects.
        The new keyword complicates the code and slows down execution speed.
        String objects can produce unexpected results
    </b>
